🏥 SmartCare - AI-Powered Healthcare Access Platform
🚀 Overview
SmartCare is a backend-first healthcare assistant platform built using FastAPI, MongoDB, and LLM integrations. It addresses healthcare accessibility challenges with multilingual support and intelligent appointment routing, designed to communicate with patients in their preferred language.

This README outlines:

✅ Phase 1: Implemented core APIs

🛠️ Phase 2: Upcoming hackathon features

✅ Phase 1: Implemented Features
🔹 Multilingual Symptom Checker (Enhanced Description ✅)
Accepts symptom descriptions in regional languages (e.g., Telugu, Hindi).

Understands and speaks back in the user’s preferred language using LLM prompting.

Guides the user to the correct medical department based on the interpreted symptoms.

Enables seamless communication between patient and system in their native language, improving comfort and accuracy.

🧠 Example: If a patient says “పొట్ట నొప్పి” (stomach pain) in Telugu, the system interprets it, determines it relates to Gastroenterology, and responds in Telugu to guide the user.

🔹 Appointment Booking API
Auto-selects department and optionally the doctor based on symptoms.

Books an available slot based on the patient’s preferred date.

🔹 Available Slots API
Endpoint: /available-slots

Input: department

Output: Available doctor appointment slots
